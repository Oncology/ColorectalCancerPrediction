Colorectal Cancer Prediction, Using Gene Expression Data

This project attempts to create a prediction model to detect colorectal cancer using gene expression.

As part of the Cancer research conducted at Princeton University, colorectal cancer cells are analyzed with genechip microarrays for differentially expressed genes and this data is publically available at http://genomics-pubs.princeton.edu/oncology/.

The 'Notterman Carcinoma Data' data set from princeton research is used in this project for prediction modelling of colorectal cancer from gene expression.
